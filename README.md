##Before you start

Download, install, and configure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as described in Configuring [Node.js Interpreters.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/configuring-node-js-interpreters.html)

##Creating a new Angular application

You can use the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io) package or create an empty WebStorm project and install Angular in it.

```markup
npm install -g angular-cli
